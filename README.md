# Design Patterns Examples in Java

Welcome to the Design Patterns Learning Repository! 👋 This repository is designed to help you understand software design patterns in a simple and practical way.

## What's Inside? 📚

This repository contains examples of common design patterns organized into three main categories:

1. **Creational Patterns** - Patterns about object creation
   - Factory Pattern
   - Singleton Pattern
   - (More coming soon!)

2. **Structural Patterns** - Patterns about object relationships
   - (Coming soon!)

3. **Behavioral Patterns** - Patterns about object communication
   - (Coming soon!)

## Getting Started 🚀

### What You Need

- Java installed on your computer
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension for VS Code to view the design diagrams

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the Patterns**: 
   - Each pattern is in its own folder under `src/Creational`, `src/Structural`, or `src/Behavioral`
   - Each pattern folder has:
     - A `README.md` explaining the pattern
     - Java files with the implementation
     - A main class showing how to use the pattern

2. **Learning Path**:
   - Read the pattern's README.md first
   - Look at the diagrams to understand the structure
   - Check the code implementation
   - Run the example to see it in action

### Running the Examples

To run any example:

1. Navigate to the pattern's folder
2. Look for the main class (ends with "Main.java")
3. Compile and run using your preferred method:
   - Using VS Code's Run button
   - Or via terminal: `java src/Creational/PatternName/PatternNameMain.java`

## Structure of Each Pattern 📖

For each design pattern, you'll find:

- **Problem Description**: What issue does this pattern solve?
- **Real-World Example**: A simple, everyday example to help you understand
- **Use Case**: When to use this pattern
- **Key Characteristics**: Important features of the pattern
- **Code Example**: Simple implementation in Java
- **Visual Diagram**: Easy-to-understand visual representation

## Need Help? ❓

- Start with the simpler patterns first (like Singleton and Factory)
- Each example is kept as simple as possible
- Read the README in each pattern's folder for detailed explanations
- Comments in the code explain what each part does

Happy learning! 🎉
